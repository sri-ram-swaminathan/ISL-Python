This repository contains my work from all the courses I have taken to teach myself Machine Learning.

- [ISL Python](): the first Machine Learning text I followed, and I have gained a solid understanding of theory and code behind supervised / classical ML from here. 

- [Neural Networks Zero to Hero](): i learnt to build many types of neural networks from first principles, and worked all the way up to GPT and it's tokenizer. My work on Karpathy's excellent course. 

-[NLP Demystified](): made my theoretical understanding of Natural Language Processing more sound. A very good course.  

-[Computer Vision](): my two projects from the course I took as part of my Master's
