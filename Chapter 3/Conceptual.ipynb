    "Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in Table 3.4 correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw based on these p-values. Your explanation should be phrased in terms of sales, TV, radio, and newspaper, rather than in terms of the coefficients of the linear model.\n",

    "> - In this case we are performing multiple linear regression of sales onto advertising (TV, radio and newspaper). The null hypothesis are : there is no relationship b/w (i) sales & TV (ii) sales & radio (iii) sales & newspaper.\n",
    "> - TV and radio have small p values. This indicates that when holding the other 2 variables fixed, an increase in TV / radio budgets corresponds to an increase in sales. More precisely the coefficient estimate gives the rate of change of sales as a function of the given predictor variable (the slope). So spending an additional 1,000 $ on TV (radio) advertising corresponds to an increase in 46 (189) sales units.\n",
    "> - However the newspaper budget has a large p value, indicating that when TV and radio budgets are held fixed changing the newspaper budget has no apparent change on sales.\n",
