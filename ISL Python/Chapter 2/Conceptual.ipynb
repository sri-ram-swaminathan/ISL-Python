    "#### Q1 \n",
    "For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors p is small.\n",
    ">  **Flexible** method will perform better, since the training error of a flexible method decreases with the number of observations (n). Moreover the error of an inflexible (linear) method will not decrease with n.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number of observations n is small.\n",
    "> **Inflexible** method will perform better, since the number of observations (n) is small, using a flexible method will lead to over-fitting and large test error.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.\n",
    "> **Flexible** method will perform better, since inflexible method assumes a linear relationship in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) The variance of the error terms i.e. $\\sigma^{2}=Var(\\epsilon)$ is extremely high. \n",
    "> **Inflexible** method will perform better, since a flexible method will result in over-fitting and loss of generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3 \n",
    "We now revisit the bias-variance decomposition. \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Provide a sketch of typical (squared) bias, variance, training error, test error, and Bayes (or irreducible) error curves, on a single plot, as we go from less flexible statistical learning methods towards more flexible approaches. The x-axis should represent the amount of flexibility in the method, and the y-axis should represent the values for each curve. There should be five curves. Make sure to label each one.\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Explain why each of the five curves has the shape displayed in part (a).\n",
    "> - Bayes error : the minimum value of the irreducible error in the estimate of the data. It is independent of the method, and thereby the flexibility of the method. \n",
    "> - Bias : as flexibility increases, the method fits the data more closely, thereby reducing the error due to approximating the nature of the data. \n",
    "> - Variance : as flexibility increases, the method reduces generalizability, thereby increasing the variability of the method with different data sets. \n",
    "> - Training Error : reduces monotonically since a more flexible method fits the training data more closely.\n",
    "> - Test Error : initially reduces with an increase in flexibility which reduces the bias of the method, but as the flexibility increases further the variance of the method increases resulting in over-fitting and hence large test error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q5\n",
    "What are the advantages and disadvantages of a very flexible (versus a less flexible) approach for regression or classification? Under what circumstances might a more flexible approach be preferred to a less flexible approach? When might a less flexible approach be preferred?\n",
    "\n",
    "The pros and cons of a highly flexible approach are :\n",
    "> - (+) High training accuracy and low bias. \n",
    "> - (+) Training accuracy increases with more data points.\n",
    "> - (-) High variance and chance of overfitting.\n",
    "> - (-) Low interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pros and cons of a less flexible approach are : \n",
    "> - (+) Low variance. \n",
    "> - (+) High interpretability.\n",
    "> - (-) High bias and chance of underfitting.\n",
    "> - (-) Low training accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more flexible approach is preferred when the aim is prediction, there is a non-linear relationship between predictors and response variable & we have a large sample size. \n",
    "\n",
    "A less flexible approach is preferred when the aim is inference, there is large variance in the error terms & we have a small sample size with a large number of predictors.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q7\n",
    "The table below provides a training data set containing six observations, three predictors, and one qualitative response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"7.png\" width=\"500\"/>  \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wish to use this data set to make a prediction for Y when X1 = X2 = X3 = 0 using K-nearest neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Compute the Euclidean distance between each observation and the test point, X1 = X2 = X3 = 0\n",
    "> The Euclidian distance between 2 points $(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1})$ and $(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2})$ is given by $ \\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}+(z_{2}-z_{1})^{2}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "> This yields in the following distances : $d_{1}=3.0$, $d_{2}=2.0$, $d_{3}=3.16$, $d_{4}=2.23$, $d_{5}=1.41$, $d_{6}=1.73$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) What is our prediction with K = 1? Why?\n",
    "> When K=1, the prediction is simply the label of the nearest point (majority class = only class). $x_{5}$ is closest and hence the prediction is **Green**.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) What is our prediction with K = 3? Why?\n",
    "> When K=3, the points in consideration are $x_{5},x_{6},x_{2}$. The labels are Green, Red and Red respectively. The majority class and prediction is **Red**.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) If the Bayes decision boundary in this problem is highly non-linear, then would we expect the best value for K to be large or small? Why?\n",
    "> As the value of K increases, the decision boundary becomes less flexible (linear). This is because the prediction for one point is an average of a large number of nearest neighbours. In this case we need a flexible (non-linear) boundary. Hence a **small** K value is best."
